<p id = a>My name is Jagat Naskar. I’m a recent elementary education graduate from Burdwan University.
	                    I’ve been working at a camp for elementary children this summer, and I’m excited to find my first 
						teaching position for the coming school year. I have several original lesson plans I created during 
						my teaching internship that I look forward to implementing in my own classroom. I attended Brookwood 
						Elementary myself and believe I would be a great fit for your second grade opening. It would be a 
						joy for me to teach students in the same place that sparked my love of learning.”</p>
